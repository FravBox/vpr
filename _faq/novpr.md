name: I don't want to use the VPR. Is there another way I can be considerate of photosensitive viewers?

Use of a standard Content Warning with an explanation of what is in the video will help.    
Example: CW: flashing, red.

A generic notice like "flash warning," "photosensitivity advisory" etc. is also helpful, but more vague than a CW.    
Using "epilepsy warning" is discouraged. It can be seen as reductive and exclusionary. Photosensitive epilepsy is not the only form of epilepsy and many photosensitive individuals are not epileptic.
