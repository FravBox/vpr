Adaptations for Events

It is important that the relays are **video-specific**. Photosensitive people are well aware of general risks for video watching, and a boilerplate advisory for the entire show does not help these viewers.

- Award ceremonies, contests, convention viewings, etc., can help accommodate photosensitive individuals in an audience by using the relays on title cards.
- Photosensitive risks can be displayed alongside other content warnings, or delineated with a header such as VPR or Potential photosensitive risks
- Short VPR may be used when listing all risks is not possible
- During on-demand showings or in contexts where the identity of people with photosensitivities are known, digital or physical handouts with the VPRs for all videos may be given ahead of the showing(s).
