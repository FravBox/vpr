While it is not required, it is recommended to give the short VPR variant directly followed by the standard/full VPR.

VPR: Motion 
Entirely comprised of characters jumping rope. Motions and patterns related to that are in every scene. Some zoom transitions.

VPR: motion, peripheral, minor red

Mixed media, but primarily 3D/CG animation. Transitions are cuts and some slow quick zooms with rare fades. Focuses on an uncooked egg, so most scenes include clear liquid motion and yellow yolk motion. Some soft light effects that for the most part should be predictable. Occasional peripheral effects, such as speedlines.

VPR: Peripheral, overlays, minor motion, minor quick cuts, minor black cuts    
CW: child abuse? blood

Video is letterboxed. Generally slow video with natural peripheral framing and soft but prominent light rays throughout, but mostly concentrated in the beginning. There is one part with quick cuts and a few rare parts with black cuts.     Isolated incidents with heavy light leaks, one section with natural particles (falling flower petals, etc). Rare isolated incidents of tunnel motion. 
Times of note:    
0:00 - 0:08 Video begins with tunnel motion    
0:38 white tunnel motion    
1:03 circles + tunnel motion     
1:35 - 1:36 circular pattern     
1:38 - 1:57 most particles     
1:58 - 1:59 moving peripheral bottom right corner     
2:14 circles

VPR: All
Semi-frequent flashing from lightning/lighting randomly throughout. First half of video uses a blurred vignette with color field offset. There are some sections of video with lower framerate than others. Some natural peripheral framing throughout, rare but isolated peripheral effects. Two isolated sections of red scenes. Transitions vary between cuts, blurs, and black dips.

0:05 video starts with characters near a mirror with a distinct frame    
0:14 - 0:27 blur, peripheral, color offset, some twinkling and light flashing    
0:47 - 0:49 peripheral + moving silhouette    
1:06 - 1:24 low framerate    
1:11 - 1:12 quick cuts    
2:06 - 2:07 peripheral bidirectional moving black bars    
2:19 - 2:26 red    
2:33 - 2:38 red

VPR: Major Strobes, major flashing & flickering, major peripheral, neon green, red/pink, blue, motion, minor red

Video has several glitch effects, hard lighting, flashing, quick cuts, flickering particles & patterns, and peripheral moving text/glitches. Neon green, red/pink, and blue are dominant throughout. Several natural strobes (e.g. trains) and some light strobes.
