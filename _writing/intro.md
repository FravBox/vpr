Make this visible somewhere before the video starts playing.

A VPR is a balance between describing what happens visually in the video with timestamps while also not being too detailed. Generally one paragraph is all that is needed. If a video is overflowing with risk factors, there is no need to list timestamps for them all unless they are isolated to one section of the video.

The relay should be visible or easily found before the video begins to play.
Always put the VPR in the title, filename, description, and/or hyperlink text to the video.
If putting the VPR inside these is not possible, place them directly next to those elements.

When possible, identify what the **exact** risk factors of the video are (not just the categories). In the case of Youtube, this is most easily done by placing it in the video's description area. If a text VPR is impossible, or an additional VPR notice is desired, place the VPR inside the video itself as a title card or overlay before any risk factors play. 

**If you include the VPR as part of the video, it should:**
-  be at the beginning
-  on screen for at least 2 seconds
-  not contain any moving elements

The most common method of making a video-based VPR is white text on a black background.

## Order of Elements

**When summarizing a video's risk factors,** they should be ordered from most likely to harm to least.

While this can vary in the context of your particular audience, most often this means the risks which happen the most frequently and/or with the most intensity come first, and are listed in this order until the last element, which has the least intensity and/or frequency.

**When listing timestamps,** the times should be listed chronologically.
