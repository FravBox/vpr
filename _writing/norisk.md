There will always be some risk associated with watching videos for photosensitive individuals. If you believe a video does not have any risk factors, you can use `VPR: No Known`.
It is important to still use VPR in these cases to show that photosensitivities were considered. Otherwise, it may come across as a normal (possibly risky) link to a photosensitive individual.
