## Intensity

These words are optional in the standard/full VPR. When used, "Major" refers to above-average intensity of risk factors and "minor" refers to below average intensity.

As an example, if the video has blurs throughout, but they are all no stronger than a radius of ~2, this could be called "minor blur" as they are weak compared to most blurs we normally see in fan vids.

If the vid has blurs and all of them have a radius of 100 or greater, that is much stronger than we're used to seeing in videos, and could be referred to as "major blur" if desired.

## Frequency

In shorter VPR variants, "major" and "minor" almost always refer to how often the risks occur.

For example, if a fan vid has no risk factors except for blurs from 0:25 to 0:30, shorter relays which do not use timestamps would instead use "minor blurs" since the blurs are only present in a small section of the video.
