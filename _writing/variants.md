name: VPR Variants
shortcode: 04
---

Please use the full VPR whenever practical. However, we realize this is not always possible. Therefore, a few variants have been developed.

## Short VPR
- Only lists categories instead of specific risks and rarely gives timestamps.
- Typically used before the full relay as a summary.
- If there is a risk factor that only occurs in one part of the video (e.g. blurs only from 0:25 to 0:30):
  - With timestamps:    
`VPR: blurs 0:25 - 0:30`
  - Without timestamps:    
`VPR: blurs 0:25 - 0:30` becomes `VPR: minor blurs`    
The singular risk is "minor" because it is only a minor part of the video.

## Tiny VPR

**This version of the relay uses letters and symbols and was constructed specifically for filenames.**    
If space is an issue, please use the short VPR in public-facing relays if at all possible.

The tiny variant starts with `V_` (uppercase "V" followed by an underscore) and uses the letters corresponding to each risk category to form the relay.

Average risks are indicated by uppercase letters and minor risks use lowercase. Major risks have a `+` (plus sign) prefix before the letter.    
If increased legibility between the letters is desired, they may be separated by an `_` (underscore).    
Example:

`Short VPR: major flashing, major strobes, high contrast, minor peripheral`    
in Tiny VPR, would become:    
`V_+F+SCp` or `V_+F_+S_C_p`
